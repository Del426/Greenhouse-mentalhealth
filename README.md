# Greenhouse mental health
 Empower hacks competion submission

This project was built to encourage people struggling with mental health to complete basic daily tasks. We know that it can be difficult for people to do things like brushing their teeth and hair when they are struggling. we also attempted to include free mental health resourses.

we learned a lot while creating this including everything from basic coding techniques to more complicated things such as creating functional buttons

currently this project has code that opens a starter page from which a person could exit or continue on to the game from. it also has a counter for completing tasks. The code is far from complete and we anticipate continuing to work on it after the competeion.

We used tkinter and and datetime for some of the functions

We don't really know what were doing and most of the code is just a handfull of tutorials we managed to patch together.
